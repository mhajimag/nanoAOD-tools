#nanoAOD Reweighting

This repository, together with [EFT2Obs](https://github.com/ajgilbert/EFT2Obs), should provide all the tools one needs to reweight nanoAOD MC samples **after** their production. The underlying principles of the tool are described [here](READMEs/underlying_principles.md) and several guides have been written:

1. [Initial setup](READMEs/initial_setup.md)
2. [Example walk through - Going from a MadGraph process line to reweighted NanoAOD](READMEs/walkthrough.md)
3. [Making adjustments for your process](READMEs/making_adjustments.md)
4. [Deriving STXS scaling functions](READMEs/scaling_functions.md)
5. [Performing your own validation](READMEs/valiation.md)
